## Machine Learning Approaches for Near-Expiration Products

 A Random Forest Classifier is used to predict the likelihood of sale for near-expiration products. The model is trained on 150k+ records and reaches a 75.8% F1-score. A Power BI dashboard visualizes key sales insights and clustering helps segment stores for targeted strategies.

The CNN model is trained using data augmentation along with regularization techniques, resulting in an accuracy of 86% for unseen music samples.
